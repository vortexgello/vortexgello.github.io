            <p> Well, technically, I don't own the printer. It's something my brother brought from his office, but it's something that I can use anytime I want. 
              </p>
              <p>Lite3Dp is a self-assembly kit that comes with all the parts you need. This printer is possibly one of the cheapest SLA 3D printers you can buy off the market. I have been eyeing this printer for a very long time. even before it started shipping in its crowdfunding campaign. How could one possibly develop and sell a 3D printer for just about $100? Even the Chinese printers on the market aren't $100. When it comes to India, we have higher prices, added taxes, and duties on all the products. All the printers sold here are imported from either the USA or China.</p>
              <p> Getting this printer to print as intended took a lot of work in my busy schedule. It was very exciting when I first got this printer, but as time passed, I started to get frustrated about it. It was unclear how a simple resin printer could't print as intended, but I later learned about how all this works and started figuring out how exactly a resin printer works.</p>
  
              <p> I joined the Lite3Dp unofficial discord and it helped a lot. I started reading all the old conversations from their discord server. It helped me understand why I was facing a certain (overexposure) issue on my 3D printer, and I wasn't the only one. Another user pointed out that the LED was too close and had to be placed further away from the LCD. This made a lot of sense. I noticed that at any exposure, my printer would make flat planes. I sought help from their discord. They suggested a mod that increases the height from the UV LED to the LCD. </p>
  
              <p> So, I began printing this new mod for Lite3Dp on my regular FDM printer. As soon as I installed this new mod for the printer, I started feeling positive about the printer again. This didn't go too well for long. The test piece that I was printing took only 10 minutes to print.</p> 
   
              <p> I tried printing a random frog from Thingiverse. I may be able to call it a success. As the basic shape of the model was printed The part didn't print well on both sides. It was incomplete and had signs of under-exposure on one side. The UV LED light wasn't diffusing the light uniformly. This was causing the issue. I later fixed this issue by adding thicker support.</p> 
  
              <p>Now, I'm getting great acceptable prints. All the effort seems to have paid off. Now I know how to operate an SLA 3D printer, and I will be capable enough to troubleshoot most SLA printers in the future.</p>
                  
            <p>I can call this design a bit rushed as the rigidity of this machine is very bad and worse than I expected. My initial plan was to be able to cut aluminium on this. Woods and plastics are what this cuts the best. 
            </p>
