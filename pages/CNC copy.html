          <h2> Casual rant about my college education system </h2>
          <p> While my pen plotter is writing a lab record for my lab exam tomorrow, I was feeling a bit bored, and now here I am ranting about this college I picked. I honestly never wanted to write something like this, but as I look more into this, a feeling in my heart keeps killing me. I don't have anyone with whom I can express this feeling of anger in my heart, but I can't fix it. I am also writing this. I wanted to check my writing skills as they have become dusty over the past few years. I haven't written any comprehension or such for at least a few years. I am also checking for grammatical errors that I am making using Grammarly. Writing is a great way to practice my writing skills for my future. 

            Anyway, the reason I'm writing is to express the feeling of anger in my heart right now. I have spent more than 12 hours writing my single machine tools lab record and haven't completed it yet. Am I that incompetant? Probably not. What makes me angrier is that I am being discouraged for being creative even by putting in my smallest effort. 
            
            If you have seen my older posts, I use my pen plotter to write my lab records and lab observations notes. This makes my faculty very angry. They deny my notes as soon as they find out I haven't written them using my hand. Once I explained the struggles I have faced while making this machine and running this machine. Sometimes, I feel that these people are inhumane and have become numb to feelings for achievements. All they care about is bullying students for marks. I'm least bothered about an A+ in my report card. I can call myself naive because I don't care about grades. It can help me in my future, just like those people have become hardcoded. I have been hardcoded to ignore my exam grade as long as I pass my subjects. 
            
            In my first year of college, I was very excited about going to college but, I didn't have any great expectations. In January of 2020, I used my 3d printer to print some assignments. I also used this to get my Chemistry lab observation written using this 3D printer. The Professor was so blind that she couldn't even catch the perfect printed writing. She always used to brag about her Ph.D. in chemistry. She was very proud and arrogant that she had done her Ph.D. She couldn't recognize my different writing styles in my record and observation book. I was very happy that she couldn't recognize the pen plotted writing. As time went on people in my class started to notice this weird perfect handwriting in my notes. People started to question me as my handwriting is filthy and recognizable. 
            
            As time passed, I started to think about actually printing a pen plotter and buying all the necessary parts for the plotter. I printed an assignment one day and then tried to submit it the next day thinking that the teacher would appreciate me or even give me a pat for this writing my assignment in perfect handwriting. The reaction was the opposite. She called me and humiliated me in the class. She also gave me 0 marks for the assignment. She also asked me to write the entire thing again. As mentioned above I am a person who's the least bothered about marks. Then covid-19 struck the world as soon as  I bought all the parts required for my pen plotter.
