          <h2> Why build another plotter?</h2>
          <p> This is a revision of the old plotter that I built more than a year ago, this uses most of the similar parts 
            that were used in the old plotter. The only problem that I had from my old plotter was 'sagging' of the axis that 
            is positioned in cantilever it drastically reduced the speed for writing as the servo motor has to travel more. 
            SG90 Servo used in this build is fairly slow and noisy. I want to replace this with a magnetic solenoid which is much more 
            quicker and refine my solidworks designs. I also imagined of an insanely fast pen plotter like those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYGPSAD5L_k&t=125s">IBM or Roland plotter</a>  
          </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3> Build and design process</h>
            <p> The design was made using SolidWorks from scratch some of the parts(motor, pulley) downloaded from GrabCAD or McMasterCarr 
              this plotter has very few part. I printed them on my stock Anet A8, soon I plan to upgrade this Anet A8 to a core xy printer. 
            I had expected a lot about this design but later got into hiccups eventually. </p>

            <p>In this design as I also wanted a fairly large A3 sized printer and no sagging I added a simple ball bearing
              on the other end so that this carriage can move any sag, with this the servo has to do the tiniest movement.
            
            </p>
            <p>The x-axis linear bearings roll on the aluminum profile. This turned out to be a bad idea in the end.</p>
            <h5>The use of measuring tape as a drag chain is something of a hack itself.</h5>

              img {
                max-width: 100%;
                height: auto;
              }
              </style>
              </head>

              <h4>Software Used</h4>
              <p>For my old plotter I was using GRBL for Arduino but this time as I repeatedly faced issues with GRBL for Arduino
                I opted for ESP32_GRBL, this one comes with wifi and bluetooth. For generating Gcode I use there's nothing better 
                than Vpype-gwrite, as I also use vpype to optimize my gcode to print faster.</p>

                <p>In the build process I killed nearly 5 A4988 stepper motor drivers, one Arduino, and an ESP32 due to my 
                  carelessness. </p>

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>
              <h4>What i learned from this design</h4>
              <p>This is another flawed design I would say the accuracy is worse the old build but what is better about 
                this one is that it can printer at marginally greater speeds which can help for writing my lab records. 
                For making generative art I would try to refine this design. I also leaned from lurking drawing bots discord server
                is that its not so simple to make an insanely fast plotter with my kind of budget. Vintage plotters were 
                ~$1000 back then so which converts to ~$5000, with that kind of budget any cheap AxiDraw would not be able to 
                compete. 
              </p>
              <p>Another bad design choice I learned is that never roll hard materials on soft materials, it is like driving 
                with steel wheels on a tarmac road one of them is going to wear out but when the materials have very different 
               hardness values one of them is going to wear out much quicker. Due to this after few days of using the plotter at max 
               speeds, I checked something is lose because the quality of the prints was worse than I expected them to be. The nearly 1mm 
                of aluminum was worn off from the extrusion as a ball bearing is much much harder. In future, I intend to buy actual 
                linear bearings that are designed for these specific purposes.</p>

                <p>The cost for building this printer is ~2500 rupees. </p>

                <p>For now I will use it for another year or 2 as I have to write my lab records frequently since we have ended
                  a major pandemic. I'm quite happy that I could finish this project.  </p>
