          <h2> Designing, validating and testing compliant mechanisms </h2> 
          <p> 
            The objective was to create the slimmest CR2016/CR2025 battery holder that could be used with the pocket UV sensor that I have in mind. I looked into several mounting and older models of Casio and Citizen pocket radios, which used to be powered by CR2032 batteries. None of the designs satisfied me. The typical PCB-mounted battery holders can be up to 4 mm thick and pointy. We decided to employ a compliant mechanism to hold the battery after doing some study and talking with my brother. I assumed the battery couldn't be tightly clamped by a compliant device.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWeErkRyxkhKL_pjYBCR2jYcvAh5PaXoP&t=491&v=iNOGucwkLK8&feature=youtu.be">Maxwell’s equation for 3D</a>, \(6-C = R\) </p>
              <p>\(C =\) Number of Non-Redudant Constraint lines </p>
              <p>\(R =\) Number of degrees of freedom</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>I designed a simple non-symmetrical flexure and printed it on my 3D printer. I was not expecting it to hold the battery (I lost the pictures and the part that was printed). The clamping force on the battery was surprisingly good. After this, I was convinced that a flexure can hold the battery on a PCB. By looking at the clamping force generated by 3D print we decided to use two PCBs sandwiched together as the negative terminal should have physical contact. </p>
              <p>In my design, the total number of Non-Redudant constraints, \(C =4\). I plan to sandwich the two PCBs, so that makes \(R =2\). A fully constraint mechanism with \(R =0\) degrees of freedom can be achieved by adding double-sided copper/conductive tape on the bottom PCB. This will seize rotation in x-axis and translation in z-axis. </p>

                <h5>First attempt to calculate the deformation of the flexure.</h5>
                <p>The basic idea was to make a tapered section (cone) and push the tapered section coin, which would push the flexure arms. Ideally, this calculation would work if all the surfaces are frictionless. I used a 20mm coin with a taper of 15 degrees, printed using the small SLA printer in green translucent resin. This attempt was flawed; the experimental and simulation values were off by a large margin. This was because friction was not taken into account. All the parts used are 3D printed, so they have a poor surface finish. The dial indicator was preloaded using a large M20 nut, which I used for the gym equipment I'm designing. This was done in order to compensate for the spring forces in the plunger mechanism. The M20 nut's weight was close to 60g. I figured later that the spring could be removed from the inside of the dial indicator. I haven't been brave enough to use it without the spring, as the dial indicator is new. The total force acting on each of the arm is

              <p> I am confident that this simple mechanism will securely hold the battery for the credit card-sized UV scanner. This project served as a tiny justification for me to finally get the dial indicator I had always desired. I want to take out the dial indicator's plunger spring in the future. Documenting this process was harder than I imagined. I hope to get a PCB made sooner or later. Having the comfort of access to two types of 3D printers (FDM and SLA) is certainly a luxury. I couldn't have done any of this if these printers weren't next to my desk. All the parts and fixtures were 3D printed. I had to wrap my head around this thing for hours to create a sensible looking design that would work. Along the way, I taught myself to get better with SolidWorks simulation, learned to set up dial indicators and got better at documenting math equations in LaTeX(HTML).</p>
